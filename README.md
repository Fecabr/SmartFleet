# SmartFleet
SmartFleet is an Open source solution supports teltonika protocol and TCP protocol tk103
- This solution  can be deployed on Azure cloud. 
- It is a distributed system that supports  AMQP protocol (for managing the comming data from boxes ) and stores  data on the MicroSoft server database.
- The solution consists of two sides :
- one for administration management, where you can add users, customers and cars (we work on it because it  incomplete yet).
- the seconde side is for customers where:
- You can  track your vehicles on run time.
- You can display the full itinerary on the map with the different activities over the time as a chronogram  along with a lot of informations such as speed, duration and addresses.
- generate reports by selecting peridos and saving them as a PDF file.
- We are working now for adding new features such as adding drivers, displaying fuel consumption reports and possibly supporting card drivers.
